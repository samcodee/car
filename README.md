### Tesla Model X
Since its release, the Tesla Model X has been subject to a series of updates in its software and hardware.

Here are 7 interesting facts about this cutting edge vehicle;

1. It pioneered as the first all-electric SUV and was released as the second vehicle from Tesla’s second generation platform.

2. Initially, Tesla has shipped a few thousand Model X SUVs with 6 and 7-seat configuration. However, recent reports have revealed that Tesla is set to introduce a 5-seat configuration. The company proudly claims it to be the best-in-class vehicle that is equipped with a second row bench seat that folds flat for this 5-seat configuration. The interior cargo storage opens up to 88 cubic feet and is designed with a 60/40 split to recline separately, or fold down entirely flat for additional cargo space. tesla model x white side

3. Although it is not recommended, the Tesla Model X could tow up to 3,500 pounds on 22” wheels. When outfitted with 20” wheels, the Tesla X towing capacity can increase to 5,000 pounds.

4. With its Falcon wing doors, the company realized the impracticality with regards to storing outdoor equipment, like skis and snowboards. Tesla designed a way for the owner to conveniently stow their skis and snowboards on the exterior of their model X. The ski and snowboard carrier can be easily assembled and now allows a lockable storage with soft rubber coated arms that secure equipment and reduce the risk of scratching the surface of either the stowed equipment or the vehicle itself. The carrier can accommodate up to 6 pairs of skis or 4 snowboards. tesla model x snowboarding

5. Ever since it has received the Golden Steering Wheel Award in 2016, the company made efforts to focus on all the software and hardware improvements done on Tesla Model X. The Falcon wing door underwent 2 improvements in its door sensor object detector. It also had a 25% improvement in the opening/closing speed. Moreover, its dynamic profile adjustment enables the indoor mode with roof sensor to detect low ceiling. The powered front doors and remote keyless entry were also given attention. The keyfob detection was refined for improved smart automatic front door behavior as you enter, approach, or leave the car.Its keyfob battery life was also improved 8 times with an automated alert from the car if the battery gets low. 51% of door issues were reduced as several improvements were made to power front door movement and latching system with enhanced performance on steep inclines. Customer reports regarding wind noise issues were also reduced by 22%. Through introducing Cabin Overheat Protection, the maximum interior temperature of Model X is more easily managed. The HVAC performance was also improved by increasing the maximum fan speed with an over-the-air software update. The seat motion, obstacle detection, pitch calibration, and usability of second row seats were enhanced through multiple over-the-air updates. Intelligent behaviours between seats were also added through software enhancements. Over-the-air software updates had also improved the vehicle’s touchscreen, graphical user interface, and Bluetooth connectivity with Tesla’s 8.0 software rollout.

6. Unplugged Performance gave a gushing review of the Tesla X. On their website, they praised the improvements done on the new front fascia, side skirt set, rear bumper, and deck-lid spoiler which made the Model X look sportier. They consider the Tesla Model X as an “amazing feat of engineering” as it enabled seven passengers to ride in the car through its unique design. modelx_white_wall_2x

7. Its smart software even allows users to adjust vehicle height for better handling, efficiency and ride comfort. Through the touchscreen, the user can raise or lower their Tesla Model X when it enters a driveway, navigates through snow, or unloads passengers and belonging

### Koenisegg Agera
You might have heard about the new Koenigsegg Agera RS breaking the Bugatti’s 0-400kph record. Well, the Koenigsegg Agera RS has now been recognized as the fastest production car ever designed. It has averaged 277.9mph in 2 ways in order to counteract the impact of gravity and wind. The Koenigsegg Agera RS was able to prove itself after the Swedish carmaker was able to conquer the 11-mile stretch of Route 160 in Nevada. The results were fascinating, as it was able to break the top speed record of production cars, such as the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport at 265.7mph back in 2010.

Here are 5 interesting facts to get to know more about this Swedish speedy car.

It utilizes advanced technology developed at the Koenigseegg One:1 program. It also features a luggage compartment and detachable hardtop that you can stow inside for top-down motoring.

It has advanced lightweight sound insulation, front winglets, all-new front splitter optimized for the tracks, advanced dynamic underbody flap system, side skirts, and active rear spoiler for more down force.

Advanced layup and composites techniques developed during the One:1 program. This would lower the curb weight in comparison with the Agera S and R models.

It also provides the choice for Koenigsegg active and self-leveling chassis package, alternative aero package, 3G connected Pre-Active chassis setups, and sound cancellation, among others.

The previous Agera S engine has been improved for regular pump gas, putting 1160bph with the regular petrol. This should be at a shocking 232bhp per liter with great reliability.

The Agera RS can be configured to run on E85 in certain markets for higher power levels. However, it can be adjusted on-the-fly to any fuel mix with its engine management system at any time.

Overall, the Koenigsegg Agera RS has an ultimate track and road versatility. In fact, you may test drive it to do the most extreme performance without worrying about road ordinance. This is because the Koenigsegg Agera RS complies with the safety standards as well as other homologation requirements around the world.
